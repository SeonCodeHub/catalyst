- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization.
- **RESTful API**: Expose endpoints for seamless integration with other services.
- **Database Integration**: Utilize databases to store and retrieve project data.
- **Dependency Injection**: Leverage Spring Boot's dependency injection for modular and maintainable code.
- **Maven Build**: Manage project dependencies and build process efficiently with Maven.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SeonCodeHub/catalyst.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd catalyst`
3. Build the project using Maven: `mvn clean install`
4. Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`


## Usage

1. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080` after starting the server.


## Branching Strategy

We follow a branching strategy that helps maintain a clean and organized codebase. The main branches in our repository are `main` and `development`.

- The `main` branch is used for production purposes. It contains stable and tested code ready for deployment. Only merge requests from the `development` branch are accepted into `main`. This ensures that only code that has been thoroughly reviewed and tested is deployed to production.
- The `development` branch serves as the integration branch for ongoing development work. All feature branches are merged into `development` after thorough testing and code review. This branch is periodically merged into `main` when a significant milestone is reached.


Both the `main` and `development` branches are protected to ensure code quality and prevent accidental changes. Only pull requests can be used to merge changes into these branches.

- **Protection Rules**: Developers are not allowed to push directly to `main` or `development`. Instead, they must create feature branches for their work. Pull requests are then submitted to merge feature branches into `development`.
- **Feature Branches**: Every developer should create a separate feature branch for their work (e.g., `feature/new-feature`). Once the feature is complete, a pull request should be opened to merge it into the `development` branch.


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow our branching strategy and protection rules when contributing to the project.

1. Create a new feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`.
2. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add new feature'`.
3. Push your branch to your fork: `git push origin feature/new-feature`.
4. Submit a pull request to merge your changes into the `development` branch.

Thank you for contributing to Catalyst!
